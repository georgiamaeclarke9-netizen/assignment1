    "For this assignment, I have decided upon using weekly adj_close prices. I used weekly data for clustering as:\n",

    "- less computational cost, leading to faster clustering\n",

From this weekly panel, I created causal features including weekly log returns, 12-week rolling volatility and 6-week momentum for each ticker, along with market level aggregates (i.e. cross sectional volaitility) for capturing overall market conditions. I drop rows with incomplete features and then split the dataset into train and test sets based on a fixed date (I chose 4th Jan 2019 as it is a Friday, it provides 9 years of training data (2010-2018) and 5 years of testing data (2019-2023)) as to avoid look-ahead bias. \n",

    "The Calinski-Harabasz index (also known as variance ratio criterion) measures \"how similar an object is to it's own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (seperation)\" according to GeeksForGeeks[6]. A higher value for CH means that clusters are dense are well seperated. \n",

    "The silhouette score is lower than it is for k=2, but CH index is slightly higher. Silhouette score is more important for intrepability however, as Silhouette has a bounded range (-1 to 1) and so is more interpretable, compared to CH, which has no bounded range.

I decided to try replacing StandardScaler() with RobustScaler() as StandardScaler() (according to GeeksForGeeks [7]), \"subtracts the mean of the data and divides it by standard deviation. This centers the data around zero and standardizes the variablity\". It is more sensitive to outliers.

    "## 4. Baseline Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "For baseline comparison, I will be using the \"Detecting Multivariate Market Regimes via Clustering Algorithms\" method (2024) by James McGreevy (Aitor Muguruza-Gonzalez, Zacharia Issa Jonathan Chan and Cris Salvi). I prepared the data via ComputeRegimes_McGreevy.py (which outputs regimes_mcgreevy_weekly.csv) and ran it on student_ext_mcgreevy.py (only difference between this file and student_ext.py is that this file uses the the regimes_mcgreevy_weekly.csv outputted from ComputeRegimes_McGreevy.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways of the McGreevy et al paper is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"• We develop an adapted k-means algorithm that uses the 2-Wasserstein distance metric or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and d-dimensional data in order to identify changes in joint market regimes between assets, in particular correlation.\n",
    "• We create a two-step process for finding the marginal and joint market regimes in synthetic and real data.\n",
    "• Using the two-step process, we form approximations to the mean, variance and correlation which then subsequently inform profitable portfolios of pairs of stocks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin creating my version of McGreevy et al for this assignment, I first created a script to compute regimes (ComputeRegimes_McGreevy.py), then also created the class containing the fit(), predict() and relevant mltester functions, that will use the computed regimes. For McGreevy et al (2024), the paper's main contribution is showing how it adapts clustering for the specific problem - using a probability metric (specifically; 2-Wasserstein distance between empirical measures) within it's clustering framework to compare the data segment distributions, rather than using raw data points. More specifically, the novelty of McGreevy et al's is replacing Euclidean distance with Wasserstein to compare data segment distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creation of the Regimes (ComputeRegimes_McGreevy.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following McGreevy et al's framework, I used log returns of the six sector ETFs. Weekly sampling (as I've mentioned before) reduces noise compared to daily data. By using the wide panel format (tickers as columns, dates as rows) it allows for direct application of their multivariate clustering approach. The paper states: \"We work with the log-returns of elements of the\n",
    "form S = (s0, . . . , sN ) ∈ S(R^d), which are price paths of d financial assets.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Although McGreevy et al doesn't mention standardisation, to maintain consistency with my baseline models and ensure fair distance comparisons, I standardised returns within a walk-foward framework. \n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 5.2 is a horizontal timeline of returns divided into boxes (where each box = an observation, e.g. one week). h1 represents the segment length (e.g. from the image; 5 boxes = 5 weeks). h2 represents the overlap between consecutive segments (e.g. spanning all 5 boxes / weeks). The red block indicates the current segment being clustered. The segments (\\mu_1, \\mu_2, e.t.c.) represents an empirical distribution of returns over h1 weeks, with the lower arrows showing an overlapping sliding forward windows by h1 - h2 steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented the paper's segmentation method using 20-week windows (h1) and 16 week overlaps (h2), resulting in a 4-week step between consecutive segments. As mentioned above, each segment represents an empirical distribution that forms the basis for regime detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core innovation in McGreevy et al's paper is replacing Euclidean distance with Wasserstein distance for comparing empirical distributions. Within my w2() function, I've implemented their 2-Wasserstein metric using optimal transport, specifically the Hungarian algorithm for segments (In \"The d-dimensional WK algorithm\": \"Computation of the p-Wasserstein distance... Hungarian algorithm\" (Hungarian being the \"linear_sum_assignment(C)\" in my code)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following McGreevy's two step approach, for the first step, it focuses on marginal distributions (volatility patterns).  I first applied univariate Wasserstein k-means to each asset seperately, identifying high and low volatility regimes (k=2). McGreevy et al. (2024) explains that this step removes the influence of marginal distributions (mean and variance) before analysing correlation. They write: \"We begin by applying the uni-d 1-WK-means algorithm to the data in order to remove the effects of the marginal distribution on each asset and subsequently apply the 2-d WK-means or 2-d MMDK-means algorithm to this transformed data. This method is based on the theory of copulas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow McGreevy et al's recommendation of seperating volatility effects from correlation structure, I implemented a copula transformation. In my code, this happens after univariate clustering in ecdf_from_atoms() function. For each ETF and its volatility cluster, I built an empirical CDF (ECDF) from pooled segment values, then I converted each segment's returns into Uniform(0,1) values using this ECDF. This ensures that all marginals are standardised, leaving only dependence structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When volatilty effects are removed via copula transfrmation, I performed multivariate Wasserstein k-means clustering on these copula segments to detect correlation regimes (k=2). The second stage identifies periods of high versus low interdependence among ETFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Regime labels were lagged by one period to prevent look-ahead bias, as mentioned previously in my \"Data Preparation\" section. The outputted .csv file is used by \"student_ext_mcgreevy.py\" which uses regime_lag1 when merging features to avoid leakage."
